{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)\nBetter ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!\nI wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà\nExtensive...\nAmbience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!\nFood! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)\nThe good part! Quantity üòç\nI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.\nThe daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(\nThe breads and raita were decent!\nThe Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà\nConclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.\nWould like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases.

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.\nThey're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.\nThe menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits\n\nPanko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.\nVeg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.\nCrispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.\nMakhmali Paneer Tikka -\nCottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler\nItalian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.\nCheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.\n\nI cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.\n\nThe staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!"}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.\n\nThe spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.\nDesserts are ice cream and jamun.\n\nThe taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.\n\nFish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.\nVeg spring rolls were too good.\nBig surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ\n\nKadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.\nChicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.\n\nFor the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.\n\nSuggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.\n\nOverall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay."}

Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.\n\nThe food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.\n\nWe finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!"}
{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.\n1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly.

She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & \"Italian\" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu."}
{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service."}

{"id":"Flechazo","text":"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...\n\nAmbience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!\n\nStarters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!\n\nDelicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.\n\nDesserts ahhahahhhaa!!!\nYou have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!\n\nThe ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.\n\nOnly drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!\n\nI would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!\n\nSection wise Ratings:\n\nAmbience: 3.5/5\nStaff: 3.5/5\nFood: 4/5\nBuffet items: 4.5/5\nOverall: 4/5"}

{"id":"Flechazo","text":"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.\nThe place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.\nBut for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)\nBetter ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!\nI wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà\nExtensive...\nAmbience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!\nFood! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)\nThe good part! Quantity üòç\nI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.\nThe daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(\nThe breads and raita were decent!\nThe Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà\nConclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.\nWould like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases.

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"Wonderful place with awesome ambience, best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods. Shubro and Papiya were good with service."}
{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"Good ambience and great service.We've had buffet for 25 people.The waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad.\nShoutout to Shubro and Pradeep ,took care of our entire Afternoon."}
{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.\nThey're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.\nThe menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits\n\nPanko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.\nVeg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.\nCrispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.\nMakhmali Paneer Tikka -\nCottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler\nItalian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.\nCheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.\n\nI cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.\n\nThe staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!"}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.\n\nThe spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.\nDesserts are ice cream and jamun.\n\nThe taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.\n\nFish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.\nVeg spring rolls were too good.\nBig surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ\n\nKadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.\nChicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.\n\nFor the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.\n\nSuggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.\n\nOverall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.\nBut. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.\n\nThe food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.\n\nWe finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!"}
{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.\n1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.\nBecause of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & \"Italian\" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more."}

{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu."}
{"id":"Beyond Flavours","text":"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service."}

{"id":"Paradise","text":"Mumbaikars have heard about the famous paradise restaurant... Hence decided to try out this one with great hope.\nAmbience at this place is great; however i was not really impressed with the food and service.\n\nWe ordered :\nChilli chicken : 2.5/ 5\nPaneer tikka : 3.5/5\nChicken masala : 0.1/5 ... lowest rating possible\nChicken biryani: 3/5\nGarlic naan: 2/5\n\nThe staff were least bothered and kept us waiting for like 20 mins jus to take order and after all that the food was very disappointing. This is only a much hyped restaurant. I would not go and recommend this place to anyone for frequent dine experience."}

{"id":"Flechazo","text":"We were 4 people who visited this place on Thursday night....Ambience and service are good .Food is disappointed.Not worth for money we pay."}
{"id":"Flechazo","text":"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...\n\nAmbience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!\n\nStarters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!\n\nDelicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.\n\nDesserts ahhahahhhaa!!!\nYou have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!\n\nThe ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.\n\nOnly drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!\n\nI would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!\n\nSection wise Ratings:\n\nAmbience: 3.5/5\nStaff: 3.5/5\nFood: 4/5\nBuffet items: 4.5/5\nOverall: 4/5"}

Starters are not much hot.. most of them are room temparature or little warm.. we have asked for fish starter.. we got only two pieces.. bbq wings are not good.. tooo hard... mango chilli prawns not much tasty... only maida coating smell.. no flavour nothing... we are not happy with flechazo, gachibowli..."}
{"id":"Flechazo","text":"Wide spread buffet, taste is good too, courteous staff very polite. We had a family dinner there and all of us had a lovely time especially kids love the live counters."}
{"id":"Flechazo","text":"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.\nThe place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.\nBut for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place."}
{"id":"Flechazo","text":"The starters were good . Especially mutton starter , They are many varieties in Chicken then other items .\nThe ambience is so good and the staff is great .\nJayanta service was very good and food was on time. Thanks to them ."}
{"id":"Flechazo","text":"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.\n"}
